# Setting up git remote origin

## First, create your project folder on your computer and initialize a git repo
1. mkdir "Project Folder Name"
2. cd "Project Folder Name"
3. git init

### OR clone an already existing github repo
1. mkdir "Project Folder Name"
2. cd "Project Folder Name"
3. git clone (repository-url)

## Next, set remote origin within git repo if one doesn't exist
1. git remote add origin (repository-url)

### IF one exists and needs to be changed
1. git remote set-url origin (repository-url)

## Finally, to check whether the origin was set correctly use
1. git remote -v

### This will return all remotes listed in the repo
